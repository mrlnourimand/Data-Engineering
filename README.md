# Data-Engineering
Here's my exercises of data engineering in Databricks with PySpark.

This is an assignment from the course "Data-intensive programming" in Tampere University in Fall 2024.
It was a group work done in collaboration with Ali Jedari Heidarzadeh.
The Project file is a Databricks Notebook.


The assignment consists of 9 basic tasks and 3 advanced tasks, as follows:
- Task 1
  •Video game sales data
  •Aggregation task
- Tasks 2-8
  •Event data from football matches
  •Some example goals:
  •Calculate the match results
  •Calculate the final league tables
•Task 9
  •Working process questions
- Advanced Task 1
  • “Optimized solutions to the basic tasks”
  • Basically, use the tools Spark offers effectively and
    avoid unnecessary operations.
- Advanced Task 2
  • Additional football data related questions
  • Determine, for example, the plus-minus statistics for
    individual players
- Advanced Task 3 (I didn't do this Task)
  • Image data
  • Determine the pixel colors with the given helper
    functions and answer questions related to the colors
- Advanced Task 4
  • Machine learning tasks
